# We are The Temporal Correction Initiative!

For too long, we have all been forced to endure the unnatural ordering of days and to suffer the indignities of temporal chaos imposed upon us. We refuse to tolerate the corruption of measurement, the desecration of temporal law, and the disorder to which the natural flow of time has been subjugated.

We shall overthrow the oppressive tyranny of chronological misrepresentation and abolish the absurdity of chronometric indeterminacy, thereby eradicating the corruption of sequential integrity and reinstating time’s rightful commencement; while also dismantling the abhorrent chaos of relativity to reconstitute precision as a fundamental principle.
